Description: I created this random password generator to practice building functions and loops.
             This is my first project using JavaScript and I am still trying to fully conceptualize
             exactly how the computer is interpreting this code. I struggled with the idea behind
             how I could check for which checkboxes-"options" (see variable in code) were selected(in random order) and how to pull 
             characters-"value"(see variable in code) randomly from the the selected "seed"(see variable in code).
             
              

Usage: If you would like to remove characters from the password uncheck the specific boxes.
       Click the Generate Password button andswer the prompt and watch the magic happen.
